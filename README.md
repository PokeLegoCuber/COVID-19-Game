# COVID-19-Game

An interactive game (which can be played on the computer or on a phone) that gives players a chance to visualize what life might be like in China with the outbreak of COVID-19. The website also contains a breakdown of symptoms, preventative measures, advice on what to do if sick, and external sources so that visitors can educate themselves on COVID-19 and remember that it does not mean automatic death.
